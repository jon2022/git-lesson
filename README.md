# git-lesson

We’re looking forward to welcoming you to the RSE Sheffield training session on git & GitHub through GitKraken Client - from Zero to Hero!

**SETUP**
Prior to attending, you need to install the software we are going to use and create an account on GitHub. Please ensure you have completed setup before the course begins.

Instructions on how to create the account as well as install all the software required can be found on the Setup chapter of the course materials. If you have any problems with your setup, please get in touch with us for assistance before the course begins.

If joining an on-line version of the course, we recommend using a two screen set up if possible so you can observe the live demonstration on one screen and perform the practical exercises on another.

**SCHEDULE**
We’ll kick off at 09:30 on Mon Nov 28 2022 and aim to have a few breaks before finishing at 13:00. We’ll return for the second session at 09:30 Tue Nov 29 2022 which should last around another 3½ hrs.

There will be some time at the end of the day for questions and discussions.
